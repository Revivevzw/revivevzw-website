{"ABOUT.HOW_TEXT":"Dr. Herman De Gezelle, gynecologist, had dreamed of doing humanitarian work but he lacked the time. Until 2010 Dr. Herman De Gezelle, then associated with AZ Saint-Lucas in Ghent, and colleague Dr. Jan Aerts, gynecologist from Turnhout, went to Fianarantsoa in Madagascar as members of Interplast Germany to operate on vesicovaginal fistulas. Ethiopia followed in 2012 and with a few like-minded people the REVIVEvzw non-profit organization was founded and recognized by the Belgian government in 2014.","ABOUT.HOW_TITLE":"How?","ABOUT.INTRO":"REVIVEvzw is a Belgian non-profit organization that carries out medical humanitarian missions in developing countries with an emphasis on Africa. REVIVEvzw’s activities are aimed at people who, due to their living conditions, normally do not have access to specialized medical care.","ABOUT.TITLE":"About us","ABOUT.WHAT_TEXT":"\"REVIVE\" means “to bring new life”. REVIVEvzw offers new opportunities to people in need of care, who for various reasons do not have access to specialized heathcare. The pathologies treated are very diverse ranging from uterine prolapse, enlarged thyroid gland or goiter, inguinal hernia, cleft lip, clubfoot, orthopedic trauma… as well as dental caries, oral hygiene and prenatal consultation. We are gratefull to use the opportunity to also provide training to the local medical staff. Moreover, we give the opportunity to Belgian students from the medical sector to gain unforgettable experiences in unique internships. Each mission lasts approximatively two weeks (for internship students 4 weeks). Each time about a hundred people are helped free of charge and relieved of their physical complaints. For them this often means that they fully participate in daily life again.","ABOUT.WHAT_TITLE":"What?","ABOUT.WHO_TEXT":"REVIVEvzw is a non-governmental non-profit organization recognized by the Belgian government that carries out medical humanitarian missions in developping areas, mainly in Africa.
